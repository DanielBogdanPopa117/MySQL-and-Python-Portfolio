# MySQL-and-Python-Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio with my projects in MySQL and Python.

###1.Project SQL - biblioteca / library

Description : Creating a database for managing a library with tables for books, authors and loans.
  SQL Queries: Utilized to perform various operations such as data retrieval, updates, and deletions.
-JOINs: To combine data from multiple tables (e.g., joining the books and authors tables).
-Aggregate Functions: Like COUNT() for counting the number of loans per reader, MIN() and MAX() for finding the oldest and newest book publication dates.
-Foreign Keys: To maintain relationships between the books, authors, and loans tables, ensuring referential integrity.
